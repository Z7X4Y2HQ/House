## 1.1 Introduction

<a id="11-introduction"></a>
Maybe you have played *Life is Strange*, for that time, the scenes were amazing, characters were relatable and loveable, and the dialogues felt realistic but felt like the character models were lacking finishing. But the story was amazing, right? Or maybe you like the stories of visual novels but most of them don’t have any gameplay at all. Or maybe you’re playing a JRPG like *Persona 5* and like its dialogue system or how the game plays out. But it’s lacking that life-like characters or animations like *Life is Strange*. Sure, the characters are great, but their dialogue animations are just not that great. There are many RPG games out there, like *Neo: The World Ends with You* or *The Caligula Effect*, that have one thing great but lacking in other areas of the game.

*Skipped a Beat* is a narrative adventure game that hopes to provide a fun and immersive experience. We are targeting a game that mixes the RPG element of *Life is Strange* and *Persona 5* with a little touch of visual novels, with some extra features that the players would love to see in-game. What I think could catch a player's attention is the way our story is written, as it has multiple endings. And going through each ending could be a playful experience for the player.

When a character talks to an NPC, they will have different choices. Depending on which option the player chooses, the storyline will change based on that. Each storyline will have a different ending. There will be a lot of other factors that affect the storyline like knowledge, guts, and kindness. For example, if the player decides to study a lot in his high school life and get good grades, he’ll have the opportunity to become a psychiatrist, psychologist, or a doctor. These different jobs will have slightly different endings. And if the character’s education stat is low, that is if the player doesn’t study much but decides to do other activities or just go to sleep at the end.

### Narrative Elements
- **Story Setting**
  -  The story setting of *Skipped a Beat* is a high school in Japan, specifically during Takahashi's second year. The school serves as the primary location where most of the events in the story take place, including the classrooms, corridors, and school grounds.

<a id="1112-world-setting"></a>
- **World Setting**
  - The world setting of *Skipped a Beat* includes a supernatural element where the protagonist finds himself trapped in a time loop, where he restarts to a certain year after certain conditions are fulfilled.

<a id="1113-plot"></a>
- **Plot**
  - The plot of *Skipped a Beat* follows Takahashi, a high school student who finds himself stuck in a time loop after realizing he has skipped his entire first year of high school.

    - **Chapter 1**  
  Takahashi finds himself in an absurd situation where he’s skipped his first year and doesn’t know anything about his first-year self. As he’s still a middle schooler in his mind, the idea of having a girlfriend is revolting for him. So, impulsively he shouts at his supposed girlfriend, Aoi, and gets a weeklong suspension.

    - **Chapter 2**  
  After Takahashi’s return to school from suspension, he finds a transfer student in Aoi’s seat who’s apparently from his middle school. Apparently, Aoi changed schools. Later, Takahashi gets a note from Shinichi, a guy from his class who liked Aoi. Crazy as he was, he pulls out a knife threatening to kill Takahashi. Takahashi and Sachi get close after this incident as she saves him from Shinichi’s stupid fight.

    - **Chapter 3**  
  Takahashi’s sitting in a park with Sachi and telling her the reason why he doesn’t like the idea of getting close with girls.

    - **Chapter 4**  
  Takahashi and Sachi arrive in class and are bombarded with questions relating to their relationship and the fight with Shinichi. Due to this, Takahashi finds out about his two friends from the first year, Eiji and Hina. Takahashi decides to tell Eiji, Hina, and Sachi about what happened after middle school and how he has skipped his first year.

    - **Chapter 5**  
  Takahashi and his friends are standing in the gym as he tells them that he has skipped a year, which is unbelievable, of course. But Sachi talks about Takahashi coming to Kyoto to meet her last year. And think possibilities of how that could be possible if Sachi never told anyone where she lived.


<a id="1114-characters"></a>
- **Characters**
  - Takahashi Tanjiro
  - Sachi
  - Eiji Kintaro
  - Hina Ito
  - Aoi Sakamoto
  - Shinichi
  - Aiko Sakata
  - Takahashi’s Mom
  - School Teacher


<a id="1115-point-of-view"></a>
- **Point of View**
  - The story is told from a First-Person Perspective. This gives the reader the ability to see directly what Takahashi and other characters are thinking. This can make the story engaging, and the reader might find characters relatable.


<a id="1116-style"></a>
- **Style**
  - The style of this story is a mix of genres, including romance, drama, science fiction, and psychological thriller.


<a id="1117-themes"></a>
- **Themes**
  - The theme of this story is the idea of acceptance and coming to terms with the inevitability of certain events in life. Takahashi's initial struggle is trying to understand and break out of the time loop, but as he learns more about the situation and becomes emotionally attached to Sachi, he realizes that there are some things that he cannot change.

<a id="112-gameplay"></a>
### Gameplay
The game starts with the scene of Takahashi waking up from a bizarre dream and going down from his room to the kitchen to find a knife to end his life. As he enters the kitchen, his mom will ask why you aren’t getting ready for school.

<a id="1121-dialogue-tree"></a>
- **Dialogue Tree**
  - Here you’ll have multiple options to choose from to reply, such as:
    - I was just thirsty.
    - I don’t want to go to school.
    - I will, I just needed a knife.

  Just like this dialogue, there will be numerous other conversations throughout the game that the player can engage in, and the choices they make during these interactions will have a significant impact on both the player's character and    the non-player characters around them. These choices may influence the game's story, character relationships, and potentially lead to different outcomes and endings, making each playthrough a unique and engaging experience.

<a id="1122-interactable-objects"></a>
- **Interactable Objects**

  When you get close to a knife, you’ll have the option to grab it, and then stab yourself. Interacting with certain objects in the game world can open up new dialogue options and potentially reveal hidden information or storylines, encouraging players to explore and interact with their environment in order to fully experience the game's narrative.

  After you have found a knife and stabbed yourself, your screen goes dark, and then you find yourself standing in a white void-like place. And then you wake on your bed again, but you don’t remember anything about the previous scene, so you just get up and go wash your face, and this is where the actual game starts.


<a id="1123-game-elements"></a>
- **Game Elements**
  - **Time**  
    You’ll have to keep track of time in this game as it is the most important element of the game.
    
  - **Mobile Phone**  
    You’ll have a mobile phone with you all the time to check the time and do other various activities like opening settings or checking the map.
    
  - **Talking with NPCs**  
    You’ll have the option to talk to some NPCs around you and just have a normal conversation. Or when you must talk to your friends or someone for the game progression.
    
  - **Day/Night Cycle**  
    After you get home from school, it will be night, and you’ll have to go to sleep to go to the next day.
    
  - **Character Stats**  
    Stats like the player's knowledge, guts, and kindness that are used to measure the player character’s abilities and progress throughout the game. This mostly will affect how the ending changes.

---

## 1.2 Objective

<a id="12-objective"></a>
- The game allows the player to follow the story by completing the objectives.
- The player won’t be able to progress unless they complete the given objectives.

---

## 1.3 Problem Statement

<a id="13-problem-statement"></a>
Most Visual Novels don’t have the gameplay element, which kind of makes them not so engaging unless the story is intriguing. Players find them repetitive, uninteresting, and lacking depth. Even writing a story that can catch the player’s attention has become a difficult feat to accomplish. And even if you do get a game with gameplay and a good story, the overall feel of the game, its models, characters, or just the environment isn’t that great. There are a lot of visual novels and narrative adventure games, but each has its flaws. It should provide players with a captivating narrative, diverse gameplay mechanics, and meaningful choices that impact the outcome. Additionally, the game should have visually appealing graphics and high-quality sound design.

---

## 1.4 Assumptions and Constraints

<a id="14-assumptions-and-constraints"></a>
### Assumptions:
- Players will be engaged by the game's narrative and characters.
- Choices made by players will have meaningful consequences.
- Visual and audio assets will enhance the immersive experience.
- Multiple story paths and endings will provide replay value.

### Constraints:
- Limited development time and resources.
- Technical limitations imposed by the chosen game engine.
- Availability and skill level of artists and designers.
- Localization and translation requirements.
- Complexity of writing and game design.
- Testing and quality assurance to ensure a polished product.

## 1.5 Project Scope

<a id="15-project-scope"></a>
A narrative-driven experience with interactive dialogue trees and choices that affect the game's story. The game will feature interactable objects that reveal hidden information and encourage exploration of the game world. The time element will be crucial, with day/night cycles, mobile phones to keep track of time, and decision-making affecting the player's character stats. The game's main objective is to find out how he skipped a year and what happened in that year, with objectives that must be completed to progress through the story.
