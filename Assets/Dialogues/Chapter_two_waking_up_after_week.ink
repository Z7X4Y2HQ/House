It's been a week since my suspension started. #speaker:Takahashi thinking #animationBool:isWalk
Today's 8th April, I'm supposed to go to school today. 
But what will I do about her, Sakamoto Aoi...
No, that's not the problem, what matters right now is, how will I act around her, 
What will she do when she sees me, Should I apologise today? 
Iâ€™ll ask her to listen to me one last time, and then I'll try to tell her about my stupid situation. 
Maybe she'll hear me out...
I should get ready for school, its getting late.
